# Notes

It is impossible for the model to predict exactly when neurons will fire, so it instead predicts only the average rate.
As a result, the output looks nothing like histograms for neural activity.
If we surgically attached the output of this model to a mouse/person, it would clearly be extremely different than what their brain expects.
A more reasonable thing to output than the max-likelihood estimation of how likely a neuron is to be firing would be a replica of semi-random firing patterns.
I will attempt to make a second model which creates this. Generative adversarial?

Re-create the image from firing activities?
